// Tests wrangler's `tunnel/client.ts` `resolveTunnelId` helper, which
// accepts either a UUID or a tunnel name and resolves the latter via
// the SDK's `zeroTrust.tunnels.cloudflared.list` endpoint. cf doesn't
// expose this helper — name-or-id resolution for Cloudflare Tunnels is
// handled either by the user passing the UUID directly to forge-
// generated `cf zero-trust tunnels cloudflared {get,delete,...}`
// commands, or (in future, if added as a forge `paramOverride.derive`
// primitive) by a generic name→id lookup. There
// is no `tunnel/client.ts` in cf. Out of scope for the wrangler-tests
// corpus.
