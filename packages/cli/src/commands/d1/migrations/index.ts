/**
 * `cf d1 migrations` — D1 migration file lifecycle.
 *
 * Hand-written rather than generated: applying migrations is a filesystem
 * walk plus N calls to one endpoint, which the generator (one command per
 * operation) cannot express, and the file discovery / ordering / bookkeeping
 * semantics have no representation in OpenAPI. There is no D1 migrations
 * operation in the spec at all, so this is a whole sub-group added to the
 * generated `d1` tree rather than a leaf override — see
 * `HAND_WRITTEN_SUBGROUPS` in `generator/hand-written-overrides.ts`, and
 * `migrations-drift.test.ts` for the guard that keeps this in step.
 *
 * This does name a product — it talks to `client.d1.*` and owns the
 * `d1_migrations` table convention — which is the documented exception to
 * the "no API product names in `src/`" invariant that every entry in that
 * table takes.
 *
 * Local mode uses the same bookkeeping SQL against Miniflare's persisted D1
 * storage, so a project can switch between cf and Wrangler without replaying
 * migrations.
