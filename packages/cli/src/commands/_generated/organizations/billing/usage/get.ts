Each record represents one billable metric for one account on one day. This includes all metered usage, including usage that falls within free-tier allowances and may result in zero cost. The response includes usage for every account belonging to the specified organization. **Note:** Cost and pricing fields are not yet populated and will be absent from responses until billing integration is complete. When `from` and `to` are omitted, defaults to the start of the current month through today. The maximum date range is 31 days. An organization with no accounts, or an organization ID that does not exist, returns a successful response with an empty result set rather than an error."
