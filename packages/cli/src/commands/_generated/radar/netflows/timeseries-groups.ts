Append `control` to request the equivalent previous period for comparison: the comparison window is shifted back by the current window's length rounded up to a whole number of weeks, so it keeps the same weekday alignment and does not overlap the current window (e.g. `7dcontrol` covers days -14 to -7, `10dcontrol` covers days -24 to -14). For example, pass `7d` and `7dcontrol` to compare this week with the previous week. All series must resolve to the same duration as the main series; relative ranges (including `control`) satisfy this automatically. Use this parameter or set specific start and end dates (`dateStart` and `dateEnd` parameters).",
