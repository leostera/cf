			"$0 analytics sql introspection get\n\nReturns the analytics dataset catalogue. By default, the response contains dataset names, titles, descriptions, and kinds. Set `include_columns` to include each dataset's column names, descriptions, and data types. The caller must have Account Analytics Read permission on the account identified by `account_tag`. Dataset names, descriptions, and columns are the same for every authorized account. When `include_custom_attributes` is set, the response also includes custom attribute names and types discovered from that account's own data, which legitimately differs per caller. The catalogue lists the datasets this deployment is able to describe, which is not a fixed list. Some datasets are described by the service that owns them and are listed only where that service is available, so the same account may see a different catalogue in different environments, and datasets may appear or disappear without a change to this API. Clients should query the catalogue rather than hard-coding it, and should not treat a dataset's absence as proof that it does not exist. Workers Analytics Engine datasets are named by the account that writes them, so they are discovered from that account's own data rather than from a fixed list. They appear as `events.analyticsEngine.<dataset_name>` and differ per account. A dataset is listed for as long as any of its data is retained, so it does not disappear from the catalogue merely because writes have stopped. An account with a very large number of datasets may receive a truncated list. Set `include_wae=false` to omit them. Log Explorer datasets are listed only where the account has them, so they differ per account and are not part of the static catalogue. Set `include_lex=false` to omit them."
